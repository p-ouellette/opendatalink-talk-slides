# Introduction

## Open Data Link

- Dataset search engine for open data.

- Search methods:

    - Semantic keyword search

    - Joinable table search

    - Unionable table search

## Motivation

- Governments and other organizations publish a lot of open data, but discovery
  is still difficult.

- Data scientists can identify ways to integrate datasets.

- Data publishers can see the wider context of their data.

## Dataset crawl

- 10k of 42k datasets on Socrata.

- 172k columns.

- Most datasets are small.

- Largest datasets have over 100 million rows.

# Joinable table search

## Minhash[^broder]

- Data sketch for estimating Jaccard similarity of sets.

$$J(S, T)=\frac{|S \cap T|}{|S \cup T|}$$

- A minhash signature is composed of the results of a number of minhashes.

- The probability that the minhashes for two sets are the same equals the
  Jaccard similarity of the sets[^mmds].

- Minhash LSH hashes similar signatures to the same bucket.

## LSH Ensemble[^zhu]

- Set containment is a better measure for computing joinability.

$$C(Q, X)=\frac{|Q \cap X|}{|Q|}$$

- We can convert Jaccard similarity to containment, given the sizes of the
  domains.

- The size of the indexed domain is not constant, so domains are partitioned by
  cardinality.

- A minhash LSH index is constructed for each partition.

# Unionable table search

## Unionable table search

- The LSH Ensemble index is queried for each column of the query table.

- Candidate tables are those that appear in $\geq{40\%}$ of the joinability
  queries.

- Candidates are ranked by alignment: the fraction of candidate columns that are
  unionable with a query column.

# Semantic keyword search

## Overview

- FastText: words -> vectors

- SimHash: vectors -> bit vectors

- LSH: similarity search on bit vectors

## FastText

- Vectors represent the semantics of words

- Closer a pair of vectors, closer the semantics of the two words

- closeness or similarity of vectors := Cosine-Similarity

## Simhash

- Vector of floats -> Vector of bits

hash := an array of length H
For vector with dimension d:
  Compute wether it is above or below d hyperplanes H times

## SimHash LSH

- L hash tables of bit vectors

- Query each L hash table for M candidates

- Compute cosnine similarity of unhashed vectors to return top-M results

## LSH Forest

- Prefix Tree of bit vectors

- Variable length hash in tree solves tunability probelm

- Query L Prefix Trees (the LSH Forest) for M candidates

- Compute cosnine similarity of unhashed vectors to return top-M results

# Future work

## Future work

- Organizing datasets into a directory structure for navigation.

- Use semantic similarity of attribute names in unionable table search.

- Similar dataset search based on metadata similarity.

- Keyword search over data values.
