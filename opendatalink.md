## Open Data Link

- Dataset search engine for open data.

- Search methods:

    - Semantic keyword search

    - Joinable table search

    - Unionable table search

## Motivation

- Governments and other organizations publish a lot of open data, but discovery
  is still difficult.

- Data scientists can identify ways to integrate datasets.

- Data publishers can see the wider context of their data.

## Demo

## Dataset crawl

- 10k of 42k datasets on Socrata.

- 172k columns.

- Most datasets are small.

- Largest datasets have over 100 million rows.

# Joinable table search

## Minhash[^broder]

- Data sketch for estimating Jaccard similarity of sets.

$$J(S, T)=\frac{|S \cap T|}{|S \cup T|}$$

- A minhash signature is composed of the results of a number of minhashes.

- The probability that the minhashes for two sets are the same equals the
  Jaccard similarity of the sets[^mmds].

- Minhash LSH hashes similar signatures to the same bucket.

## LSH Ensemble[^zhu]

- Set containment is a better measure for computing joinability.

$$C(Q, X)=\frac{|Q \cap X|}{|Q|}$$

- We can convert Jaccard similarity to containment, given the sizes of the
  domains.

- The size of the indexed domain is not constant, so domains are partitioned by
  cardinality.

- A minhash LSH index is constructed for each partition.

# Unionable table search

## Unionable table search

- The LSH Ensemble index is queried for each column of the query table.

- Candidate tables are those that appear in $\geq{40\%}$ of the joinability
  queries.

- Candidates are ranked by alignment: the fraction of candidate columns that are
  unionable with a query column.

# Semantic Keyword Search

## Semantic Keyword Search

 - Problem: Given a list of keywords, return datasets which are more similar 
 than threshold $t$. 

 - Motivation: Data scientists want a simple way to find new and insightful 
 datasets

## Our Approach

- Search on the metadata, not on the data in the dataset
  - Data in dataset is too noisy

- Metadata that we have:

  - Dataset description

  - Column description

  - Datasets tags

## Our Approach (Cont.)

- Use semantic NOT syntactic similarity 

  - Example: Fish & Seafood

  - Example: Coronavirus & Respitory System

## Others Approach

 - Google Dataset Search

## System Overview

- FastText: word in dataset's metadata -> embedding vector

- SimHash: embedding vector -> bit vector

- Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH): build index on the bit vector of each word

## FastText[^fastText]

- Word in dataset's metadata -> embedding vector

- Embedding vector represent the semantics of words

- Embedding vectors are learned from wikipedia articles

[^fastText]: A. Joulin, E. Grave, P. Bojanowski, T. Mikolov, [*Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759)

## FastText (Cont.)

- closeness or similarity of vectors := Cosine-Similarity

- Closer a pair of vectors, closer the semantics of the two words

  - PICTURE

## Simhash

- Embedding Vector -> Bit Vector

  - PICTURE

## Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

- Underlying data structure: Hash Table

  - Predefined # of buckets

- Insert SimHashed embedding vectors into hash table

- Collitions in hash table buckets are candidate pairs. 

## SimHash LSH (Cont.)

- Perdefined # of hash tables

- Query each L hash table for M candidates

  - $M \geq k$

- Order M candidates into a top-k list by the cosine similairty of embedding 
vectors

## Problem with SimHash LSH

- The # of hash tables and # of buckets in each hash table must be 
**hand tuned**

- Must be retuned when data size significantly changes

- PICTURE

## LSH Forest

- Underlying data structure: Prefix Tree or Trie

- Similar to LSH

  - Predefined # of prefix trees

  - Query each L hash table for M candidates

    - $M \geq k$

## LSH Forest (Cont.)

- Variable length hashing in prefix tree solves LSH's problems

- PICTURE

- Prefix Tree expands and contracts to account for # of embedding vectors

  - Thus, no hand tuning

## Answering Queries

- Query the index with each keyword in the keyword list

- Add the results to a list

- Rank datasets by how often they appear in the list

## Problems

- No semantic relationships **between** words

  - Example: Keyword List := "traffic violations"

    - Produces good results for "traffic" and "violations", but not 
    "traffic violations"

# Future work

## Future work

- Improve ability to see semantic relationships between words

- Organize datasets into a directory structure

- Use semantic similarity of column names in unionable table search.

- Similar dataset search based on metadata similarity.

- Keyword search over data values.
